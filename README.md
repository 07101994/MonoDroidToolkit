## What is it?
MonodroidToolkit is a kit of views that I have created or port from java into Xamarin.Android (Mono for Android). I have found them very useful in my different projects.

## What is included?
* [Complete] VerticalTextView : Turn you text 90 or 270!
* [Complete] ScrollingTextView: Scrolls text in the view
* [Complete] GridViewNoScroll: Automatically expandes the height of the gridview so you can put it inside of a list view or scroll view
* [Complete] StickyViewPager: Disable view pager from moving if you desire
* [Under Development] SystemUiHider: port of auto hiding the ui in Android
