## What is it?
MonodroidToolkit is a kit of views that I have created or port from java into Xamarin.Android (Mono for Android). I have found them very useful in my different projects.

## What is included?

### Views

* VerticalTextView : Turn you text 90 or 270!
* ScrollingTextView: Scrolls text in the view
* GridViewNoScroll: Automatically expandes the height of the gridview so you can put it inside of a list view or scroll view
* StickyViewPager: Disable view pager from moving if you desire
* SelectEndEditText: EditText view that always puts cursor at the end when focus is given. Great for remote control interfaces.

### Utilities

* SystemUiHider: port of auto hiding the ui in Android 
* NetworkUtils: Get IP/MAC/Hostname of android device
* ImageLoader: Simple delay image loader and caching mechanism

### Preferences

* IntEditTextPrefence: Enfoces an integer is entered on an edit text preference
* IntListPrefrences: Allows you to specify integers as the values.
